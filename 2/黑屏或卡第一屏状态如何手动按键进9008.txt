2. Start the timer by pressing the button until the phone vibrates, stop the timer, and calculate the number of seconds spent.
3. Subtract 1 from the number of seconds calculated to get the number of seconds for the force restart button to take effect. For example, if the key is pressed to vibrate for 12 seconds, the number of seconds that the button will take effect is 11 seconds.
4. Press and hold the power button and volume again to add, and the long press time is the number of seconds that the button just calculated takes effect. Immediately release the power button and press and hold the volume up or down.
